      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is ceremonial-grade matcha?",
          answer: "Ceremonial-grade matcha is the highest quality matcha, made from the youngest tea leaves and ground using traditional stone mills. It has a vibrant green color, smooth texture, and naturally sweet taste without any bitterness."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between ceremonial and culinary grade?",
          answer: "Ceremonial grade is meant to be whisked with water and consumed pure, while culinary grade is better for cooking, baking, and making lattes. Our ceremonial grade has a superior taste and texture perfect for traditional preparation."
        },
        {
          question: "How much caffeine is in matcha?",
          answer: "One serving of matcha (1-2 tsp) contains about 70mg of caffeine, roughly half that of coffee. However, matcha provides sustained energy without jitters thanks to L-theanine, which promotes calm focus."
        },
        {
          question: "What are the health benefits of matcha?",
          answer: "Matcha is rich in antioxidants (catechins), supports metabolism, provides calm energy, may boost immune function, and contains chlorophyll which supports detoxification. It's also known to promote mental clarity and focus."
        }

    {
      category: "Preparation & Usage",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How do I prepare traditional matcha?",
          answer: "Sift 1-2 tsp of matcha into a bowl, add 60ml of 70Â°C water, and whisk in M or W motions until frothy. The key is using cooler water (not boiling) and whisking vigorously to create the perfect texture."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need special tools?",
          answer: "While you can start with a regular whisk, we recommend a traditional bamboo whisk (chasen) for the best results. Our Starter Kit includes all the traditional tools you need."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I make matcha lattes?",
          answer: "Absolutely! While our ceremonial grade is perfect for traditional preparation, you can also use it for lattes. Whisk the matcha with a small amount of hot water first, then add steamed milk."
        },
        {
          question: "How much matcha should I drink daily?",
          answer: "1-2 servings per day is ideal for most people. Start with one serving and see how your body responds. It's best consumed in the morning or early afternoon."

        },
        {
          question: "Can I track my order?",

        },
        {
          question: "What if I'm not satisfied with my purchase?",

      category: "Storage & Freshness",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How should I store my matcha?",
          answer: "Store matcha in a cool, dry place away from light and air. Keep it in the original tin or an airtight container. For best quality, consume within 6 months of opening."
        },
        {
          question: "Should I refrigerate matcha?",
          answer: "You can refrigerate unopened matcha to extend its shelf life, but once opened, store it at room temperature in an airtight container to prevent condensation."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I know if my matcha is fresh?",
          answer: "Fresh matcha should be vibrant green, have a sweet grassy aroma, and taste smooth without bitterness. If it's brown or tastes bitter, it may be old or low quality."
